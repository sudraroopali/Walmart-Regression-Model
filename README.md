# 📊 Predictive Model for Walmart Sales Estimation


## 📢 Project Overview : 
One of the leading retail stores in the US, Walmart, would like to predict the sales and demand accurately. There are certain events and holidays which impact sales on each day. There are sales data available for 45 stores of Walmart. The business is facing a challenge due to unforeseen demands and runs out of stock some times, due to the inappropriate machine learning algorithm. An ideal ML algorithm will predict demand accurately and ingest factors like economic conditions including CPI, Unemployment Index, etc.

Walmart runs several promotional markdown events throughout the year. These markdowns precede prominent holidays, the four largest of all, which are the Super Bowl, Labour Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The weeks including these holidays are weighted five times higher in the evaluation than non-holiday weeks. Part of the challenge presented by this competition is modeling the effects of markdowns on these holiday weeks in the absence of complete/ideal historical data. Historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions are available.

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Unveiling insights from the data! Through captivating visualizations like line plots, bar charts, and correlation matrices, I explore patterns and relationships within the dataset, gaining a deeper understanding of the factors influencing weekly sales. 📊

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing
Setting the foundation for a robust model! I handle outliers, ensure data integrity, and employ techniques like datetime conversion for enhanced interpretability. 

## 📏 Scaling
Leveling the playing field! Standard scaling ensures uniformity across features, preventing any single variable from dominating the model due to differences in scale.

## 🤖 Model Development
A powerhouse of algorithms ready for action! From tried-and-true Linear Regression to sophisticated ensemble methods like Random Forests, each model is trained to capture the nuances of Walmart's weekly sales patterns. 🚀

## 🎛️ Hyperparameter Tuning
Fine-tuning for optimal performance! I performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize the configuration of each model, ensuring they deliver the most accurate and reliable predictions for Walmart's weekly sales.

## 📊 Model Evaluation
Measuring success from all angles! The models undergo a rigorous evaluation process, utilizing metric such as R-squared to assess their accuracy and reliability in predicting weekly sales.
